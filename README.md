## Problem statement
These days every store has some kind of customer of privilage card. When you have a card of each of these stores your wallet will get to 
full and it can be hard to find the correct card at the cassiere. With my app, this problem will be solved. You can scan and save each card
on your app. Now you can find the card of the store more easily and it saves a lot of space in your wallet. Find the nearest store of your
privilage card to shop.

Review similar app from Goolgle Play Store:
Ik was altijd klantenkaarten kwijt of had ze niet bij me. Mijn beurs was 15cm dik alleen al door klantenkaarten! Was een grote ergenis.
Met deze app heb ik alle klantenkaarten altijd bij de hand.

#### Hardest parts:
* **Scanning the barcodes**
* **Saving the barcodes to the user's profile**
